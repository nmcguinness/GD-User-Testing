# User-Testing for Game Development 
## User-Testing Lab Report Template (GCA only)

## 1. Title Page[^notes1]
**Project / Game Title:**  
**Date of Report:**  
**Author / Team:**

[^notes1]:
- Provide essential information such as:
  - Title (e.g., “Galaxy Explorer”)
  - Date (e.g., “01/02/2025”)
  - Author/team (e.g., “Team Alpha: Alice, Bob, Carol”)
- Keep it concise and professional.


## 2. Executive Summary (Optional)[^notes2]
**Purpose of Testing:**  
**Key Findings (Summary):**  
**Recommendations (Summary):**

[^notes2]:
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview for stakeholders who need a quick read.  
- **Key Findings**: Emphasize the most critical or impactful insights.  
- **Recommendations**: Summarize high-level suggestions.  
- Example:  
  > *“This user-testing session aimed to identify major usability issues in the new tutorial level.  
  > Key findings indicate that players struggled with the crafting interface, prompting an immediate redesign.  
  > We recommend streamlining the interface and adding in-game hints.”*


## 3. Introduction[^notes3]
**Context & Background:**  
**Scope of Testing:**  
**Objectives:**  

[^notes3]:
- **Context & Background**: Summarize the game’s genre, platform, and development stage (Alpha, Beta, etc.).  
- **Scope**: State what specifically is being tested (tutorial, first two levels, etc.).  
- **Objectives**: Outline the specific questions or goals (e.g., “Is the new resource system intuitive?”).


## 4. Methodology[^notes4]
**Test Design & Approach:**  
**Test Scenarios / Tasks:**  
**Metrics Collected (Quantitative & Qualitative):**  

[^notes4]:
- Describe how you conducted the tests (usability tests, playtests, think-aloud protocol).  
- Mention if sessions were remote (Zoom, Skype) or in-person.  
- Example tasks: *Complete a tutorial, fight the first boss, etc.*  
- List metrics (time on task, error rates, user comments).


## 5. Participants[^notes5]
**Recruitment & Criteria:**  
**Number & Demographics:**  
**Consent & Ethical Considerations:**  

[^notes5]:
- Explain how participants were recruited (friends, professional testers, random volunteers).  
- Include demographics if relevant (e.g., gaming background, age range).  
- Note any ethical steps (informed consent, confidentiality agreements).


## 6. Materials & Tools[^notes6]
**Software / Hardware Specifications:**  
**Testing Environment:**  
**Data Capture Tools:**  

[^notes6]:
- Detail specific hardware/software used (OS, CPU, game build version).  
- State if sessions occurred in a lab setting, living room, or online.  
- Note any recording or survey tools (OBS Studio, Google Forms, etc.).


## 7. Procedure[^notes7]
**Test Session Flow:**  
**Facilitator & Observer Roles:**  
**Instructions Given to Participants:**  
**Session Duration:**  

[^notes7]:
- Provide a step-by-step sequence of the testing process.  
- Example:  
  1. Welcome & consent forms  
  2. Brief explanation of game controls  
  3. 15-minute play session with think-aloud feedback  
  4. Post-test interview or questionnaire


## 8. Data Analysis[^notes8]
**Quantitative Analysis:**  
**Qualitative Analysis:**  
**Key Observations:**  

[^notes8]:
- **Quantitative**: Summarize numeric data (completion times, success rates).  
- **Qualitative**: Summarize recurring themes from interviews/surveys.  
- Explain how you grouped or coded feedback (e.g., affinity diagrams, theming).

 
## 9. Results[^notes9]
**Findings by Category:**  
**Critical Issues:**  
**Positive Outcomes:**  

[^notes9]:
- Present findings clearly (bullet points, charts, or tables).  
- Separate major categories (UI, mechanics, performance, etc.).  
- Highlight big wins (where users had fun, liked the interface) and big pain points (confusion, crashes).


## 10. Discussion[^notes10]
**Interpretation of Findings:**  
**Limitations of the Study:**  
**Comparisons to Previous Testing (If Any):**  

[^notes10]:
- Relate these findings back to your initial objectives.  
- Mention unexpected results or whether goals were met.  
- Discuss study constraints (small sample, only one device type).  


## 11. Recommendations[^notes11]
**Suggested Improvements & Priorities:**  
**Action Plan:**  
**Plan for Future Tests / Follow-Up:**  

[^notes11]:
- List changes or fixes, ideally in priority order (must-fix vs. optional).  
- Provide a direct roadmap for the dev team.  
- Example:  
  > *“We recommend redesigning the crafting menu, adding a tooltip for each resource.  
  > In the next round of testing, we’ll focus on verifying these changes.”*


## 12. Conclusion[^notes12]
**Main Takeaways:**  
**Value of Findings:**  
**Future Considerations:**  

[^notes12]:
- Recap the overall impact of the user-testing results.
