| **Development Team**           |                                        |
| **Testing Period**             | (Start Date - End Date)                |
| **Current Development Stage**  | (Alpha, Beta, etc.)                    |
| **Test Version**               | (Build Number, Date)                   |
| **Prepared by**                | (Name, Role)                           |
| **Date**                       | (DD/MM/YY)                              |

## Objectives  
- [ ] Identify usability issues in UI and controls.  
- [ ] Assess core mechanics for intuitiveness and functionality.  
- [ ] Evaluate player engagement and game balance.  
- [ ] Collect feedback on performance and technical issues.  

## Test Groups & Participants  
| Test Group | Number of Participants | Experience Level |  
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|  
| Year 1 Students | X | Beginner |  
| Year 2 Students | X | Intermediate |  
| External Testers (if applicable) | X | Mixed |  

## Testing Methodology  
### A. Usability & Core Mechanics Testing (Weeks X-X)  
**Objective:** Ensure intuitive UI, controls, and core gameplay mechanics.  
**Methods:**  
- Think-aloud protocol  
- Basic usability surveys  
- Gameplay session recordings  

### B. Playability & Engagement Testing (Weeks X-X)  
**Objective:** Assess game pacing, difficulty, and engagement.  
**Methods:**  
- A/B testing of mechanics  
- Collect structured feedback on UI and sound  
- Identify common player failure points  

### C. Balancing & Refinements (Weeks X-X)  
**Objective:** Fine-tune mechanics, fix critical issues, and polish core gameplay.  
**Methods:**  
- Focused playtests for progression balancing  
- UI/UX iteration based on usability feedback  
- Performance optimizations  

### D. Final Testing & Pre-Release Polishing (Weeks X-X)  
**Objective:** Ensure game stability, polish, and readiness for final release.  
**Methods:**  
- Final gameplay testing sessions  
- UI and sound refinements  
- Performance testing across different setups  

## Test Cases  
### A. Usability Test Cases  
| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail | Comments |  
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------|  
| UI-001 | Open main menu and navigate options | Clear and accessible | | |  
| UI-002 | Complete tutorial level | Smooth experience without confusion | | |  

### B. Gameplay Test Cases  
| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail | Comments |  
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------|  
| GM-001 | Move character using controls | Responsive and intuitive | | |  
| GM-002 | Complete first level | Balanced difficulty | | |  

## Feedback Collection  
- Post-test survey forms (Likert scale, open-ended questions).  
- Observation notes from facilitators.  
- Session recordings and playtester reactions.  

## Reporting & Action Plan  
- Summary of key findings from each testing phase.  
- Prioritized list of issues using MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't Fix).  
- Iteration and improvement plan for upcoming development cycles.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- Informed consent form for participants.  
- Data privacy and secure storage of collected feedback.  

## Test Results & Conclusions  
**Summary of Findings:**  
**Key Fixes & Adjustments:**  
**Next Steps:**  

## Appendix A: Test Case ID Prefixes & Categories

| Prefix | Category Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| UI     | User Interface - Tests related to UI elements, menus, navigation, and visual accessibility |
| GM     | Gameplay Mechanics - Tests covering player controls, physics, interactions, and core mechanics |
| AI     | Artificial Intelligence - Tests for enemy behavior, NPC interactions, and pathfinding |
| SND    | Sound Design - Tests ensuring proper audio cues, background music, and volume balance |

<!-- speaker: This slide breaks down the different categories of test case IDs that we’ll be using. Each test case has a prefix that defines its focus—whether it’s UI-related, a gameplay mechanic, or even network performance. Keeping a structured naming convention makes it easier to track and analyze test results. -->
